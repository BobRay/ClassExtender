ClassExtender is a utility to create custom database tables in MODX and the classes to support them. By default, ClassExtender creates an extended modUser object called extUser and an extended modResource object called extResource, but it's capable of creating any custom table and class. 

As of version 2.3.3, ClassExtender's operation is much simpler, and it provides an autoloader for any classes it creates as well as managing the namespace and extension package objects automatically.
