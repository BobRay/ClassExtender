<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>These resources under the ClassExtender/Examples folder are not polished examples, they are unstyled, and will need to be modified to meet your needs. If you don't already have versions of them duplicate them before making any changes and edit the duplicates.</p>

<p>That said, they should get you started on your own versions. They can also serve as tests if you run ExtendModUser or ExtendModResource and leave the settings at their defaults.</p>

<div class="box">
  <p>Important: note that they won't work unless you perform that following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Run ExtendModResource and/or ExtendModUser</li>
    <li>Make sure that the appropriate ClassExtender plugin(s) are enabled</li>
    <li>Edit users and/or resources in the Manager</li>
    <li>Add data to the extra fields and save them</li>
  </ul>

    <p>The steps above populate the custom tables. Until that happens, these examples won't find anything to display</p>
</div>
