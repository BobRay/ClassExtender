<h3>RegisterPostHook</h3>

<!-- Set the &redirectTo property to the ID of
     your "Thanks for Registering" page -->

<!-- Note: The <code>activation</code> property works the opposite of the
way you might expect it to. If it's <code>1</code> (<code>true</code>),
the created user's `modUser` record will be saved as inactive, and the
user will have to respond to an email to become an active user, or the
active field will have to be set manually.

If it's <code>0</code> (<code>false</code>, the user will be saved as an active user. -->
